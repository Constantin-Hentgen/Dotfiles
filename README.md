## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A fresh installation of Fedora Linux with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/).

If needed, set the keyboard layout to BÃ‰PO AFNOR:

```bash
setxkbmap -layout fr -variant bepo_afnor
```

Install [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/): [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html)

Run:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Constantin-Hentgen/Dotfiles.git
cd Dotfiles
ansible-playbook ansible/playbook.yml --ask-become-pass -e "username=YOUR_USERNAME"
```

You can get your username by running the command `whoami`.

Now may want to reboot, keep in mind that the keyboard layout switched.
